# Nursery website

### [Live Demo](http://nursery-app.herokuapp.com/)

Nursery website featuring administration, public pages and parents area. There are three different users: superadmins, admins and parents. Superadmins have permission to perform CRUD actions on all resources. Admins can add, update and delete everything except other admins. Parents can access the galleries hidden from the general user, read nursery's newsletters and see upcoming events.

Visitors of the site can get detailed information about the nursery and the services offered. There is a "Reguest Viewing" button on the main page calling modal with request form for those willing to visit. In Carrers, job applicants can read about job openings and apply. For the users who have further questions there is a contact form in Contact page.
